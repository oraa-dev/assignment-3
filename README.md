I have carefully worked on my assignment to ensure that it is fully mobile responsive at Mobile S (320x477) resolution, following the mobile design provided in the Figma file for Assignment 3. The Figma file includes both desktop and mobile versions, and I have done my best to match the mobile layout as accurately as possible.

If possible, I would truly appreciate it if my assignment could be reviewed specifically in Mobile S (320x477) using Chrome DevTools, as this resolution best reflects the intended mobile design.

Thank you so much for your time and effort in reviewing my work. I sincerely appreciate the guidance and support!
